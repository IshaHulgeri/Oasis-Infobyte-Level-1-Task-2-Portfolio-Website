            <br>
            <p>
                As a dedicated and third-year Computer Engineering student at MMCOE College, Karvenagar, Pune, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. My relentless work ethic and commitment to excellence have been the driving forces behind my academic success and project achievements.
                <br>
                <br>
                My proficiency extends across a diverse set of technical skills, including C, C++, Java, HTML, and CSS, with a particular focus on web development. This foundation, coupled with my proactive approach, allows me to tackle complex challenges and deliver innovative solutions. Beyond technical prowess, my journey has also honed my soft skills, contributing to my confidence and effective communication abilities. I am eager to bring my passion, skills, and diligence to contribute meaningfully in a dynamic and collaborative professional environment.
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking forward to the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills, I am confident in my ability to make valuable contributions to any team or project.
